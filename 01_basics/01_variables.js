/*
1. var, let and const are different types of variables. All of them can be hoisted. In hoisting, we move variables 
and functions to the top before they are initialized. 
2. During hositing "var" are initialized to "undefined" whereas "let" and "const" are not initialized. Although "let" 
and "const" can be hoisted like "var" but they cannot be accessed. "var" if accessed before initlization, will 
return "undefined" whereas "let" and "const" variables remain in temporal dead zone (they will give reference 
error if accessed in this zone) until they are initialized. Temporal dead zone is the time between when a variable
is decleared and when it is initialized.
3. "var" and "let" can be overwritten but const cannot as they cannot be changed.
4. Both "let" and "const" are block-scoped variables i.e. they can be accessed only within the block whereas "var"
can be accessed anywhere.
5. Block-scoped variables "let" and "const" cannot be redeclared.
6. "var" should never be used.
