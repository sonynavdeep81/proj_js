/*How is javascript code executed */
/*First of all Global execution content(GEC), an environment to execute javascript code is created that contains top-level code (the code that is not inside any function). So top level code is executed first. Functions are executed when they are called. There is only 1 GEC per program and can have multiple execution contexts (EC), each created when a particular function is called. All the execution contexts together make a call stack*/
