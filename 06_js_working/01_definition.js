/*Javascript is a high level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, single-threaded, dynamic, garbage collected programming language with first-class functions and non-blocking event loop concurrency model*/

/*A paradigm is a structuring approach for the code. Javascript supports 3 paradigms:
1.Procedural programming
2.Object-oriented programming
3.Functional Programming  */

/*Everything in javascript is objects except following primitive values:
1.Numbers
2.Strings
3.Boolean
4.Undefined
5.Null
6.
7.
 */

/*In case of first-class functions, functions are treated as variables. We can pass them into functions and functions can also return them. */

/*Dynamically typed means the datatype is automatically determined from the value*/

/*It has single thread of execution, so it can execute one task at a time. So if we have a long task to execute, it can block the execution of other tasks. To remove this bottleneck, an event loop is employed that makes this process non-blocking and allow other tasks to execute concurrently. */
